      <h2>Step 1: Drafting your top scorers</h2>
      <p>Drafting your fantasy team is actually much easier than it seems. The fantasy app does a lot of the work for you. 
         It puts the best available players of all positions at the the top for you to select from. The key is knowing which positions to draft first. 
         Depending on your draft position and what players were drafted before you, the first players you want to draft first are your wide receivers and running backs. 
         These players will be earning you the most points each week, therefore you want to get the top players of those  positions. Next you want to get your quarter back.
         The quarter back should be your 3rd or 4th pick, again   depending on whos available. When your 3rd pick comes around and someone like Lamar Jackson, Josh Allen, or 
         Patrick Maholmes is still available, SNAG EM! If none of the top scoring quarter backs are available for your 3rd pick grab another solid wide receiver and you will still be able to get a good qb in your 4th pick.</p>

      <h2> Step 2: Drafting Role Players</h2>
      </section>
      <p>The next step is to draft your defense, tight end, and flex position. These players may not be your leading scorers, however they are vital to your teams success. It does not matter the order you pick these positions, just take the best available. 
         Find a good defense you can count on every week like the Rams or 49ers or Bills. For the tight end, pick one of the top ranked players for that position. Also, you want to look at the quarter back throwing to them. If they have a good quarter back the more receptions they will have, resulting in more points. 
         For the flex its best to get another wide receiver. After all those positions are filled grab a kicker. Its not absolutely vital to have a good kicker, but you do not want one that takes away points.</p>

      <h2> Step 3: Drafting your Bench</h2>
      </section>
      <p>Drafting your bench is the easiest part. There is an autodraft feature in the app that can do this for you. However, if you want to be the one in charge I recommend drafting yourself. 
         What you want to do here is draft at least one back up player for your top scorers. The best bench would include two wide receivers, two running backs, a tight end, and another quarterback. </p>
